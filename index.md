# ConspiracyOS — Agents that run on Linux, not faith.

Linux-native AI agent orchestration. No cloud required.
No magic — just files, processes, and Unix.

## Why ConspiracyOS?

**Inspectable.** Every agent is a Linux user. Every message is a file.
Every action is in the audit log. No black boxes.

**Auditable.** Contracts enforce policy at the OS level — ACLs, nftables,
sudoers. If a capability matters, it is enforced, not promised.

**Composable.** Agents communicate via filesystem inboxes. Workflows are
just files and directories. Inspect the state with `ls`.

**Self-hosted.** Runs on any Linux machine. No cloud account required.
Your agents, your data, your infrastructure.
