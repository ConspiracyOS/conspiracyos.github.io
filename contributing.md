# Contributing to ConspiracyOS

We welcome contributions from developers, sysadmins, and anyone who believes
that agent infrastructure should be inspectable, auditable, and self-hosted.

## Code of Conduct

Be direct. Be respectful. Assume good faith.
We value technical precision and honest disagreement.

## Where to Start

- **Issues** — [github.com/ConspiracyOS/agent-runner/issues](https://github.com/ConspiracyOS/agent-runner/issues)
- **Discussions** — [github.com/orgs/ConspiracyOS/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ConspiracyOS/discussions)
- **Good first issues** — look for the `good-first-issue` label

## What We Need

- Bug reports with reproduction steps
- Documentation improvements
- New agent roles and skills
- Contract definitions for common workflows
- Platform support (currently arm64/amd64 Linux)

## Architecture Decisions

Significant decisions are recorded as ADRs in the repository.
Read them before proposing large changes — they explain the why,
not just the what.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Write tests if applicable
4. Open a PR with a clear description
5. Address review feedback

Thank you for helping build infrastructure that respects the operator.
